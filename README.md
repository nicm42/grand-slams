## General info
I created this simple project so I had an example of jQuery in my personal projects. And it was a bit of excitement, giving the number of days until the next Grand Slam. I wrote this early in 2020 when there was no reason to suspect that the Grand Slams would be cancelled/change dates. Now it's just depressing and still too uncertain to update.
