# Grand Slams

This page gives you the option to select any of the four Grand Slams. It will then tell you if the one you selected has already happened this year, is currently being played or if it's upcoming - and how many days it is away.

Although it uses SCSS it's really just CSS because it's so simple. It uses some jQuery, also pretty simple stuff.
